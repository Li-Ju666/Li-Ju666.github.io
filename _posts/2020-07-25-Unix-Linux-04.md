Previous article has explained how to operate on directory files, here in this article, we will go further about
how files are managed in Unix/Linux, to be more precise, how file hierachy structure are constructed on physical
disks. Also we will implement a simple program ``pwd`` with what we learned. 

#### From disk to files
Let's start from an entire disk drive. 
Physically disk can be divided as numerous sectors, one of which is of 512 bytes. 
Logically, we can divide the disk into several partitions. Partitions can 
be divided of different sizes. Apart from partitions, the first sector of disk called MBR is pre-defined.
MBR is used to boot the computer and record the starting and ending of address of each partition. In MBR, one
partition is marked as active and this MBR will lead computer to go this partition when computer boots. 

For different partitions, block is defined: block is the unit of OS dealing with data from disk. A block contains
fixed-size of sectors. Each partition are divided into 4 portions, boot blocks, a superblock, inode arrays and 
data blocks. Inside the boot block, necessary files to boot an operating system are stored. If the partition 
is marked active in MBR, MBR will read boot blocks into memory when booting. 

Superblock contains some important information about the partition: a magic number identifying as UFS filesystem,
partition size, status and other metadata about the partition. It is critical to the file system that it is 
sored in multiple redundant copies. All files information are stored in a structure named inode and all inodes
are stored in inode array. Other blocks are called data blocks, where all real files are stored at. 

#### How hierachy is organized
The hierachy of Unix/Linux file system is organized by inode and directory files. In each directory file, two
special records are stored, ``.`` and its own inode number, and ``..`` and its parent folder inode number. If
some files are stored "in this folder", the directory file will also record file names and their corresponding
inode number. 

#### When a new file created...
What will happen when a new file is created? 

As the number of inodes are fixed, and every file is related to an inodes, so there must be many free inodes. 
<br>1). When a new file is created, the system will find a free inode. 
<br>2). The size of the file will be evaluated and free data blocks will be assigned. The file will be stored
in these data blocks. 
<br>3). Block numbers will be stored in inode, so that inode know where data are actually stored at disk. 
<br>4). Then we need to add the file into directory file: The system will open the directory file and insert
the name and the inode number of the new file.

#### When we ``cat`` a file
When we ``cat`` a file with a file name: 

<br>1). The current directory file will be opened: with the file name, the system will know the inode number
of the file; 
<br>2). With the inode number, the system will visit the inode array to find the inode, and access the block
numbers of where the file is actual stored on disk; 
<br>3). With block numbers of disk, the system is able to copy data from disk to kernel buffer and print 
them on screen.

#### When we ``cd`` a directory
When we ``cd`` a directory: 

<br>1). the system will open the directory file of current directory, and know the inode number of the folder
to be access; 
<br>2). with the inode number, the system will change its working directory to the target one. 

#### When we ``mv`` a file
When we ``mv`` a file: the system will simply remove the record of the file from current directory and 
add it to the target directory: the inode number keeps the same, because nothing literally happened to inode
and file itself. 

#### Hard link
As we have known that files are actually stored in data blocks and tracked by a unique inode number. We know a
file is in a "directory" only because the directory file record the file name and its inode number, like a 
pointer. Naturally we will think: what if an inode number appears in two directory files, like
two pointers are pointing to a single address. Actually this is so-called hard link. The inode will keep tracking
how many directories are storing them with a variable nlink. For regular files, if no directory is tracking this
inode, it will be freed. And for directory files, at least two hard link exists: one is by it self, noted by 
``.``, another is by its parent directory, noted by the directory name. 

#### Soft link
There is another type of link called soft link. Soft link is a seperated file, which has its own inode structure.
It is nothing but a path of another filel recorded. When the file tracked is deleted or moved, the soft link
will become a dead soft link. 

#### Dealing with large files
An inode structure is of fixed size, so, number of blocks that can be stored in inode structure should be fixed
as well. In linux, 15 block numbers can be stored at most. What if a file have a size that exceeds 15*block_size.
Actually only 12 positions are used to store the where file are actual stored, while other 3 are singly indirect
pointer, doubly indirect pointer and triply indirect pointer, shown as following.

#### Implementation of pwd
Finally if we want to implement our own ``pwd`` program, following steps should be followed: 
1. Open current directory file with ``opendir()`` and save the inode number of ``.``; 
2. open its parent directory file and search the name with saved inode number, and save the name; 
3. go to 2). recursively till the root directory, in which the inode number of ``.`` is the same as ``..``; 
4. print the directory name and return.
