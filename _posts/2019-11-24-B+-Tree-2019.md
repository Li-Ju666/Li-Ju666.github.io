## B+ TRee
This is the problem in the assignment 1 of Database Design 2. Here are my solutions. 
### Problem Description
> Construct a B+-tree for the following set of key values (in the given order): 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31. Show (step by step) how the tree is constructed after each addition. Assume that the tree is initially empty and values are added in ascending
order. Construct the B+-trees for the cases where n=4 fits in one node. 
> Besides, do following tasks: A. insert 9, 10, 8 in the order given; B. Delete 23 and 19. 

### Problem Solution
Actually the problem contains two operations on B+-tree: insertion and deletion. Firstky,   we will insert elements in the tree one by one and tell how every essential step works.
