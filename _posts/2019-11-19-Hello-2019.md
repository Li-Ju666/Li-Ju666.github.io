## Subset Sum Problem
This is the problem in the assignment 1 of Course Algorithm and Data Structure 2. Here are my solutions.  
### Problem Description
> Given a set P of prices for items in a gift shop, as well as a total amount t of money collected by a group of people towards buying birthday presents for a common friend, 
the birthday present problem is to determine whether there exists a subset $P'\subset P$ whose sum is exactly t,
since we do not want to distribute any excess money back to the donors. For example, if
P = {1, 7, 2, 32, 56, 35, 234, 12332} and t = 299, then the subset P
0 = {2, 7, 56, 234} is a solution,
but there is no solution for t = 11. Perform the following tasks:
